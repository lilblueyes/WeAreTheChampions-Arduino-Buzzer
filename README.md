## How to Use

1. Connect your buzzer to the Arduino board. The positive pin (anode) should be connected to a digital pin, and the negative pin (cathode) to GND.

2. Download the supplied code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE or other compatible software.

3. Once the code has been downloaded, the melody will automatically start playing on the buzzer.

## Melody

The melody is pre-defined in the code and corresponds to the notes required for playing "We Are the Champions". Each note is defined by its frequency and its duration.

## Note Durations

Each note has a corresponding duration that specifies how long the note should be played. The duration is defined as a fraction of a whole note. For example, `1` represents a whole note, `2` represents a half note, `4` represents a quarter note, and so on.
